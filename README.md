#C++ Programing - Assignment 3 - CST8219 - Algonquin College - Computer Engineering - Computing Science

- Develop Assignment 2 further by introducing AudioFrame and VideoFrame classes inheriting from the abstract Frame class.
- Implement polymorphic inheritance and the pure virtual function void Frame::CalculateFrameResources().
- Utilize AnimationManager to manage a vector of Animation objects, each containing a forward_list of Frame* pointing to either AudioFrame or VideoFrame.
- Adhere to provided code without modifications for compatibility with testing.
- Implement dynamic memory management with new and delete, ensuring no memory leaks.
- Perform input/output operations with cin and cout, and use string objects for names.
- Ensure polymorphic function CalculateFrameResource() is overridden in AudioFrame and VideoFrame for resource calculation.
